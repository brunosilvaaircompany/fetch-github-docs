# Error: Agent admitted failure to sign

When trying to SSH into your GitHub Enterprise Server instance on a Linux computer, you may see the following message in your terminal:

```shell
$ ssh -vT git@{% data variables.product.product_url %}
> ...
> Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.
> debug1: No more authentication methods to try.
> Permission denied (publickey).
```

## Resolution

You should be able to fix this error by loading your keys into your SSH agent with `ssh-add`:

```shell
# start the ssh-agent in the background
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> Agent pid 59566
$ ssh-add
> Enter passphrase for /home/YOU/.ssh/id_rsa: [tippy tap]
> Identity added: /home/YOU/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/YOU/.ssh/id_rsa)
```

If your key does not have the default filename (`/.ssh/id_rsa`), you'll have to pass that path to `ssh-add`:

```shell
# start the ssh-agent in the background
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> Agent pid 59566
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/my_other_key
> Enter passphrase for /home/YOU/.ssh/my_other_key: [tappity tap tap]
> Identity added: /home/YOU/.ssh/my_other_key (/home/YOU/.ssh/my_other_key)
```
