# Suspending and unsuspending users

## About suspended users

If employees leave the company, you can suspend their GitHub Enterprise Server accounts to open up user licenses in your GitHub Enterprise license while preserving the issues, comments, repositories, gists, and other data they created. Suspended users cannot sign into your instance, nor can they push or pull code.

When you suspend a user, the change takes effect immediately with no notification to the user. If the user attempts to pull or push to a repository, they'll receive this error:

```shell
$ git clone git@[hostname]:john-doe/test-repo.git
Cloning into 'test-repo'...
ERROR: Your account is suspended. Please check with
your installation administrator.
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
```

> [!TIP] GitHub recommends suspending users where possible, rather than deleting their accounts.

## Scenarios where you cannot suspend users

Before suspending site administrators, you must demote them to regular users. See [Promoting Or Demoting A Site Administrator](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/promoting-or-demoting-a-site-administrator).

If you use certain external authentication features, you cannot manage user suspension from the site admin dashboard or command line:

* If LDAP Sync is enabled for your GitHub Enterprise Server instance, users are automatically suspended based on the scenarios that are described in [Using Ldap](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/managing-iam/using-ldap-for-enterprise-iam/using-ldap#enabling-ldap-sync).
* If SCIM provisioning is enabled, SCIM-provisioned users must be suspended or unsuspended through your identity provider. See [Provisioning Users And Groups With Scim Using The Rest API](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/provisioning-users-and-groups-with-scim-using-the-rest-api#provisioning-users-with-the-rest-api).

## Suspending a user from the command line

1. SSH into your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. If your instance comprises multiple nodes, for example if high availability or geo-replication are configured, SSH into the primary node. If you use a cluster, you can SSH into any node. Replace HOSTNAME with the hostname for your instance, or the hostname or IP address of a node. For more information, see [Accessing The Administrative Shell SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@latest/admin/configuration/configuring-your-enterprise/accessing-the-administrative-shell-ssh).

   ```shell copy
   ssh -p 122 admin@HOSTNAME
   ```

1. Run [ghe-user-suspend](/admin/administering-your-instance/administering-your-instance-from-the-command-line/command-line-utilities#ghe-user-suspend) with the username to suspend.

   ```shell
   ghe-user-suspend USERNAME
   ```

## Creating a custom message for suspended users

You can create a custom message that suspended users will see when attempting to sign in.


1. In the top-right corner of GitHub Enterprise Server, click your profile picture, then click **Enterprise settings**.


1. At the top of the page, click {% octicon "gear" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="gear" %} **Settings**.

1. Under **{% octicon "gear" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="gear" %} Settings**, click **Messages**.

1. To the right of "Suspended user page," click **Add message**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Suspend user page" section of the "Messages" settings. A button, labeled with a plus icon and "Add message," is outlined.](/assets/images/enterprise/site-admin-settings/add-message.png)
1. In the "Suspend user message" field, type your message. You can type Markdown, or use the Markdown toolbar to style your message.
1. To see the rendered message, click **Preview**.
1. At the bottom of the page, click **Save changes**.
