# About SAML for enterprise IAM

## About SAML SSO for your enterprise



If your enterprise members manage their own user accounts on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance, you can configure SAML authentication as an additional access restriction for your enterprise or organization. Single sign-on (SSO) gives organization owners and enterprise owners a way to control and secure access to organization resources like repositories, issues, and pull requests.


If you configure SAML SSO, members of your organization will continue to sign into their personal accounts on GitHub.com. When a member accesses most resources within your organization, GitHub redirects the member to your IdP to authenticate. After successful authentication, your IdP redirects the member back to GitHub. For more information, see [About Authentication With Single Sign On](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-single-sign-on/about-authentication-with-single-sign-on).

> [!NOTE]
> SAML SSO does not replace the normal sign-in process for GitHub. Unless you use Enterprise Managed Users, members will continue to sign into their personal accounts on GitHub.com, and each personal account will be linked to an external identity in your IdP.


Enterprise owners can enable SAML SSO and centralized authentication through a SAML IdP across all organizations owned by an enterprise account. After you enable SAML SSO for your enterprise account, SAML SSO is enforced as a requirement for all enterprise members and all organizations owned by your enterprise account. All members will be required to authenticate using SAML SSO to gain access to the organizations where they are a member, and enterprise owners will be required to authenticate using SAML SSO when accessing an enterprise account.
 For more information, see [Identity And Access Management Fundamentals](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/concepts/identity-and-access-management/identity-and-access-management-fundamentals#considerations-for-enabling-saml-for-an-enterprise-or-organization) and [Configuring Saml Single Sign On For Your Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/managing-iam/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-enterprise).

Alternatively, you can provision and manage the accounts of your enterprise members with Enterprise Managed Users. To help you determine whether SAML SSO or Enterprise Managed Users is better for your enterprise, see [Choose An Enterprise Type](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-onboarding/getting-started-with-your-enterprise/choose-an-enterprise-type).

If a SAML configuration error or an issue with your identity provider (IdP) prevents you from using SAML SSO, you can use a recovery code to access your enterprise.
 For more information, see [Managing Recovery Codes For Your Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/managing-iam/managing-recovery-codes-for-your-enterprise).

After you enable SAML SSO, depending on the IdP you use, you may be able to enable additional identity and access management features.



> [!NOTE]
> You cannot configure SCIM for your enterprise account unless your account was created for Enterprise Managed Users. For more information, see [Enterprise Managed Users](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/concepts/identity-and-access-management/enterprise-managed-users).
>
> If you do not use Enterprise Managed Users, and you want to use SCIM provisioning, you must configure SAML SSO at the organization level, not the enterprise level. For more information, see [About Identity And Access Management With Saml Single Sign On](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-identity-and-access-management-with-saml-single-sign-on).




If you use Microsoft Entra ID (previously known as Azure AD) as your IdP, you can use team synchronization to manage team membership within each organization. If team sync is enabled for your organization or enterprise account, you can synchronize a GitHub team with an IdP group. When you do this, membership changes to the IdP group are reflected on GitHub automatically, reducing the need for manual updates and custom scripts.
 For more information, see [Managing Team Synchronization For Organizations In Your Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/managing-iam/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/managing-team-synchronization-for-organizations-in-your-enterprise).

There are special considerations when enabling SAML SSO for your enterprise account if any of the organizations owned by the enterprise account are already configured to use SAML SSO.
 For more information, see [Switching Your Saml Configuration From An Organization To An Enterprise Account](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/managing-iam/using-saml-for-enterprise-iam/switching-your-saml-configuration-from-an-organization-to-an-enterprise-account).





When using SAML or CAS, two-factor authentication is not supported or managed on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance, but may be supported by the external authentication provider. Two-factor authentication enforcement on organizations is not available. For more information about enforcing two-factor authentication on organizations, see [Requiring Two Factor Authentication In Your Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-two-factor-authentication-for-your-organization/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization).


After you configure SAML, people who use your GitHub Enterprise Server instance must use a personal access token to authenticate API requests. For more information, see [Managing Your Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

If you want to allow authentication for some people who don't have an account on your external authentication provider, you can allow fallback authentication to local accounts on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. For more information, see [Allowing Built In Authentication For Users Outside Your Provider](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/managing-iam/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/allowing-built-in-authentication-for-users-outside-your-provider).

## About creation of user accounts

By default, your IdP does not communicate with GitHub automatically when you assign or unassign the application. GitHub provisions access to your resources on using SAML Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning the first time someone navigates to your enterprise's resources on GitHub and signs in by authenticating through your IdP. You may need to manually notify users when you grant access to GitHub, and you must manually deprovision access GitHub during offboarding.

Alternatively, instead of SAML JIT provisioning, you can use SCIM to provision or deprovision access to organizations owned by your enterprise on GitHub automatically after you assign or unassign the application on your IdP. SCIM for GitHub Enterprise Server is currently in public public preview and is subject to change.
 For more information, see [User Provisioning With Scim On Ghes](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/managing-iam/provisioning-user-accounts-with-scim/user-provisioning-with-scim-on-ghes).



With JIT provisioning, if you remove a user from your IdP, you must also manually suspend the user's account on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. Otherwise, the account's owner can continue to authenticate using access tokens or SSH keys. For more information, see [Suspending And Unsuspending Users](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/suspending-and-unsuspending-users).






## Supported IdPs



We test and officially support the following IdPs. For SAML SSO, we offer limited support for all identity providers that implement the SAML 2.0 standard. For more information, see the [SAML Wiki](https://wiki.oasis-open.org/security) on the OASIS website.

IdP | SAML | Team synchronization |
--- | :--: | :-------: |
Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) | {% octicon "check" aria-label= "Supported" %} | {% octicon "x" aria-label="Not supported" %} |
Entra ID | {% octicon "check" aria-label="Supported" %} | {% octicon "check" aria-label="Supported" %} |
