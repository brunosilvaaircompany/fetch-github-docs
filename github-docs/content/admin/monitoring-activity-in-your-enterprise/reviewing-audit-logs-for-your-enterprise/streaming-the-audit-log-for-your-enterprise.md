# Streaming the audit log for your enterprise

>[!NOTE] Webhooks might be a good alternative to the audit log or API polling for certain use cases. Webhooks are a way for GitHub to notify your server when specific events occur for a repository, organization, or enterprise. Compared to the API or searching the audit log, webhooks can be more efficient if you just want to learn and possibly log when certain events occur on your enterprise, organization, or repository. See [Webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks).


## About audit log streaming

You can help protect intellectual property and maintain compliance for your company by using streaming to keep copies of your audit log data. The audit log details events such as changes to settings and access, user membership, app permissions, and more. See [Audit Log Events For Your Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/audit-log-events-for-your-enterprise), [Audit Log Events For Your Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/audit-log-events-for-your-organization), and [Security Log Events](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/security-log-events).

Streaming audit log data has these benefits:

* **Data exploration**. Examine streamed events using your preferred tool for querying large quantities of data. The stream contains both audit events and Git events across the entire enterprise account.
* **Data continuity**. If you pause a stream, it retains a buffer for seven days, so there is no data loss for the first week. If the stream remains paused for more than seven days, it will resume from a point one week prior to the current time. If paused for three weeks or more, the stream won't retain any data and will start anew from the current timestamp.
* **Data retention**. Keep your exported audit logs and Git events data as long as you need to.

You can also stream agent session activity from GitHub Copilot to the same destination you use for other enterprise audit events. This is currently in public preview. See [Monitor Agentic Activity](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/manage-agents/monitor-agentic-activity#tracking-agentic-activity-in-your-enterprise-through-the-audit-log) in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

You can set up, pause, or delete a stream at any time. The stream exports audit and Git events data for all of the organizations in your enterprise, for activity from the time the stream is enabled onwards.

All streamed audit logs are sent as compressed JSON files. The filename format is in`YYYY/MM/HH/MM/<uuid>.json.gz`.

>[!NOTE] GitHub uses an at-least-once delivery method. Due to certain network or system issues, some events may be duplicated.



Enabling audit log streaming can cause a minor impact on the performance of your GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To learn about increasing resources to mitigate this performance impact, see [Increasing Cpu Or Memory Resources](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/updating-the-virtual-machine-and-physical-resources/increasing-cpu-or-memory-resources).





## Health checks for audit log streams

Every 24 hours, a health check runs for each stream. If a stream is set up incorrectly, an email will be sent to the enterprise owners. To avoid audit log events being dropped from the stream, a misconfigured stream must be fixed within six days.

To fix your streaming configuration, follow the steps in [Setting up audit log streaming](#setting-up-audit-log-streaming).



## Setting up audit log streaming

To set up the audit log stream, follow the instructions for your provider:

* [Amazon S3](#setting-up-streaming-to-amazon-s3)
* [Azure Blob Storage](#setting-up-streaming-to-azure-blob-storage)
* [Azure Event Hubs](#setting-up-streaming-to-azure-event-hubs)
* [Datadog](#setting-up-streaming-to-datadog)
* [Google Cloud Storage](#setting-up-streaming-to-google-cloud-storage)
* [Microsoft Purview](#setting-up-streaming-to-microsoft-purview) (Copilot agent session events only)
* [Splunk](#setting-up-streaming-to-splunk)



>[!NOTE] To get a list of IP address ranges that GitHub uses for connections to the streaming endpoint, use the REST API. The `meta` endpoint for GitHub.com includes a `hooks` key with a list of the IP addresses. See [Meta](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/meta/meta#get-github-enterprise-cloud-meta-information).





### Streaming to multiple endpoints

>[!NOTE] This feature is currently in public preview and subject to change.

You can stream audit logs to multiple endpoints. For example, you can stream your audit log to two endpoints of the same type, or you can stream to two different providers. To set up multiple streams, follow the instructions for each provider.



### Setting up streaming to Amazon S3



> [!NOTE]
> For streaming to S3, the AWS region that must be reachable depends on the option you select for the bucket's region.
>
> * If you select **Auto Detect**, `us-east-1` must be reachable from your appliance because the AWS SDK uses that region to detect the destination bucket's region.
> * If you select a specific region, the selected region must be reachable from your appliance. `us-east-1` does not need to be reachable unless it is the selected region.




You can set up streaming to S3 with access keys or, to avoid storing long-lived secrets on GitHub, with OpenID Connect (OIDC).

* [Setting up streaming to S3 with access keys](#setting-up-streaming-to-s3-with-access-keys)
* [Setting up streaming to S3 with OpenID Connect](#setting-up-streaming-to-s3-with-openid-connect)
* [Disabling streaming to S3 with OpenID Connect](#disabling-streaming-to-s3-with-openid-connect)
* [Integrating with AWS CloudTrail Lake](#integrating-with-aws-cloudtrail-lake)

#### Setting up streaming to S3 with access keys



To set up audit log streaming from GitHub you will need:
* Your AWS access key ID
* Your AWS secret key

For information on creating or accessing your access key ID and secret key, see [Understanding and getting your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) in the AWS documentation.

From AWS:

1. Create a bucket, and block public access to the bucket. See [Creating, configuring, and working with Amazon S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-buckets-s3.html) in the AWS documentation.

1. Create a policy that allows GitHub to write to the bucket. Copy the following JSON and replace `EXAMPLE-BUCKET` with the name of your bucket. GitHub requires only the permissions in this JSON.

   ```json
   {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
         {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",

1. On the configuration page, enter:
   * The domain where the application you want to stream to is hosted.

     If you're using Splunk Cloud, `Domain` should be `http-inputs-<host>`, where `host` is the domain you use in Splunk Cloud. For example, `http-inputs-mycompany.splunkcloud.com`.

     If you're using the free trial version of Splunk Cloud, `Domain` should be `inputs.<host>`, where `host` is the domain you use in Splunk Cloud. For example, `inputs.mycompany.splunkcloud.com`.

   * The port on which the application accepts data.<br>

     If you're using Splunk Cloud, `Port` should be `443`.

     If you're using the free trial version of Splunk Cloud, `Port` should be `8088`.

   * A token that GitHub can use to authenticate to the third-party application.
1. Leave the **Enable SSL verification** check box selected.

    Audit logs are always streamed as encrypted data, however, with this option selected, GitHub verifies the SSL certificate of your Splunk instance when delivering events. SSL verification helps ensure that events are delivered to your URL endpoint securely. Verification is optional, but we recommend you leave SSL verification enabled.
1. Click **Check endpoint** to verify that GitHub can connect and write to the Splunk endpoint.
1. After you have successfully verified the endpoint, click **Save**.




## Pausing audit log streaming
