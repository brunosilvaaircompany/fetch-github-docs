# Using the audit log API for your enterprise

>[!NOTE] Webhooks might be a good alternative to the audit log or API polling for certain use cases. Webhooks are a way for GitHub to notify your server when specific events occur for a repository, organization, or enterprise. Compared to the API or searching the audit log, webhooks can be more efficient if you just want to learn and possibly log when certain events occur on your enterprise, organization, or repository. See [Webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks).


Maintain compliance and secure intellectual property with endpoints relating to the audit log. See [Audit Log](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/enterprise-admin/audit-log) and [Orgs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/orgs#get-the-audit-log-for-an-organization).

For more information about the specific events that you can access via the audit log endpoints, see the following articles.

## Audit log details

The audit log lists events triggered by activities that affect your enterprise. Audit logs for GitHub are retained indefinitely, unless an enterprise owner configured a different retention period. See [Configuring The Audit Log For Your Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/configuring-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise).

By default, only events from the past three months are displayed. To view older events, you must specify a date range with the `created` parameter. See [Understanding The Search Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#query-for-dates).



Timestamps and date fields in the API response are measured in [UTC epoch milliseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

You can use the `read:audit_log` scope to access the audit log via the API.



## Rate limit

Each audit log API endpoint has a rate limit of 1,750 queries per hour for a given combination of user and IP address. To avoid rate limiting, integrations that query the audit log API should query at a maximum frequency of 1,750 queries per hour. Additionally, if your integration receives a rate limit error (typically a 403 or 429 response), it should wait before making another request to the API. See [Rate Limits For The Rest API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api) and [Best Practices For Using The Rest API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api). 

## Example 1: All events in an enterprise, for a specific date, with pagination

You can use page-based pagination. For more information about pagination, see [Using Pagination In The Rest API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api).



The query below searches for audit log events created on Jan 1st, 2022 in the `avocado-corp` enterprise, and returns the first page with a maximum of 100 items per page using pagination. For more information about pagination, see [Using Pagination In The Rest API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api).

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
--request GET \
"{% data variables.product.rest_url %}/enterprises/avocado-corp/audit-log?phrase=created:2022-01-01&page=1&per_page=100"
```



## Example 2: Events for pull requests in an enterprise, for a specific date and actor

You can specify multiple search phrases, such as `created` and `actor`, by separating them in your formed URL with the `+` symbol or ASCII character code `%20`.

The query below searches for audit log events for pull requests, where the event occurred on or after Jan 1st, 2022 in the `avocado-corp` enterprise, and the action was performed by the `octocat` user:

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
--request GET \
"{% data variables.product.rest_url %}/enterprises/avocado-corp/audit-log?phrase=action:pull_request+created:>=2022-01-01+actor:octocat"
```

## Example 3: Events for Git activity in an enterprise, for a specific date and actor

You can search for Git events in an enterprise, such as cloning, fetching, and pushing, by adding `include=git` as a parameter in the URL. Alternatively, you can use `include=all` to search for both web events and Git events.

The query below searches for audit log events for Git activity, where the event occurred after Jan 1st, 2024, in the `avocado-corp` enterprise, and the action was performed by the `octocat` user.

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
--request GET \
"{% data variables.product.rest_url %}/enterprises/avocado-corp/audit-log?phrase=created:>=2024-01-01+actor:octocat&include=git"
```
