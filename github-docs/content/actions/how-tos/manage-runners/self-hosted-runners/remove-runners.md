# Removing self-hosted runners

> [!NOTE]
> GitHub Enterprise Server users should use self-hosted runners. GitHub-hosted runners are **not** supported.




## Removing a runner from a repository

> [!NOTE]
> * This procedure permanently removes the self-hosted runner. If you only want to temporarily stop a runner from being assigned jobs, you can either shut down the machine or stop the `run` application. The runner will remain assigned in an "Offline" state, and won't execute any jobs until you restart the runner using the `run` application.

> * A self-hosted runner is automatically removed from GitHub if it has not connected to GitHub Actions for more than 14 days. An ephemeral self-hosted runner is automatically removed from GitHub if it has not connected to GitHub Actions for more than 1 day.

> * Just-in-time (JIT) runners can only run a single job. If JIT runners never run a job, they will automatically be removed. To remove a JIT runner before automatic removal, you must remove the JIT runner on GitHub.


To remove a self-hosted runner from a user repository you must be the repository owner. Organization owners and users with the "Manage organization runners and runner groups" permission can remove a runner from a repository in the organization. For more information about custom organization roles, see [Permissions Of Custom Organization Roles](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/permissions-of-custom-organization-roles).

We recommend that you also have access to the self-hosted runner machine.

For information about how to remove a self-hosted runner with the REST API, see [Self Hosted Runners](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/self-hosted-runners).

Alternatively, if you don't have access to the repository or organization on GitHub to remove a runner, but you would like to re-use the runner machine, then you can delete the `.runner` file inside the self-hosted runner application directory (that is, the directory into which you downloaded and unpacked the runner software). This allows the runner to be registered without having to re-download the self-hosted runner application.

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

1. Under your repository name, click **{% octicon "gear" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="gear" %} Settings**. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the **{% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="More" %}** dropdown menu, then click **Settings**.

1. In the left sidebar, click **{% octicon "play" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="play" %} Actions**, then click **Runners**.


1. In the list of runners, click on the name of the runner you'd like to configure.

1. Click **Remove**.
1. You will see instructions for removing the self-hosted runner. Complete either of the following steps to remove the runner, depending on whether it is still accessible:

    * **If you have access to the runner machine:** Follow the on-screen instructions for your machine's operating system to run the removal command. The instructions include the required URL and an automatically-generated, time-limited token.

        The removal command does the following tasks:

        * Removes the runner from GitHub.
        * Removes any self-hosted runner application configuration files on the machine.
        * Removes any services configured if not running in interactive mode.

    * **If you don't have access to the machine:** Click **Force remove this runner** to force GitHub to remove the runner.

## Removing a runner from an enterprise


If you use GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you can also remove runners from an enterprise. For more information, see the [GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation](/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/how-tos/manage-runners/self-hosted-runners/remove-runners#removing-a-runner-from-an-enterprise).

To remove a self-hosted runner from an enterprise, you must be an enterprise owner. We recommend that you also have access to the self-hosted runner machine. For information about how to remove a self-hosted runner with the REST API, see the enterprise endpoints in the [GitHub Actions REST API](/rest/actions/self-hosted-runners).

Alternatively, if you don't have access to the repository or organization on GitHub to remove a runner, but you would like to re-use the runner machine, then you can delete the `.runner` file inside the self-hosted runner application directory (that is, the directory into which you downloaded and unpacked the runner software). This allows the runner to be registered without having to re-download the self-hosted runner application.
