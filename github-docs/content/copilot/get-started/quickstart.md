# Quickstart for GitHub Copilot

## Introduction





{% webui %}

You can use Copilot to get answers to coding-related questions, such as how best to code something, how to fix a bug, or how someone else's code works. For full details of what Copilot can do, see [What Is GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/what-is-github-copilot).

Instructions for using Copilot differ depending on where you are using it. This version of the quickstart is for using Copilot on the GitHub website. Click the tabs above for instructions on using Copilot in other environments.




## Sign up for GitHub Copilot

To use Copilot, you’ll need a personal GitHub account with access to a Copilot plan. You can:

* Start with Copilot Free to explore limited features without subscribing to a plan.
* Upgrade to Copilot Pro, Copilot Pro+, or Copilot Max to unlock more features, models, and request limits.

  > [!IMPORTANT] **Starting April 22, 2026**, new self-serve sign-ups for Copilot Business for organizations on GitHub Free and GitHub Team plans are temporarily paused.

For more information about the different plans for GitHub Copilot, see [Plans](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/plans).







## Prerequisite

To use Copilot on the GitHub website, you must have an active Copilot plan. See [What Is GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/what-is-github-copilot#get-access).



## Asking your first question

1. On GitHub, navigate to a repository and open a file.
1. Click the Copilot icon ({% octicon "copilot" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="copilot" %}) at the top right of the file view.

   ![Screenshot of the Copilot button, highlighted with a dark orange outline, at the top of the file view.](/assets/images/help/copilot/copilot-button-for-file.png)

1. Type a question in the "Ask Copilot" box at the bottom of the chat panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   For example, you could enter:

   * `Explain this file.`
   * `How could I improve this code?`
   * `How can I test this code?`

   Copilot responds to your request in the panel.

1. You can continue the conversation by asking a follow-up question. For example, you could type "tell me more" to get Copilot to expand on its last comment.

## Other questions you can ask

There are many more things you can do with GitHub Copilot Chat in GitHub. For example:

* Ask a general question about software development
* Ask exploratory questions about a repository
* Find out about the changes in a pull request
* Ask a question about a specific issue or commit

1. Create a new folder for your project and open it in VS Code.
1. Open the Chat view by pressing <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> (Mac) / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or by selecting the chat icon in the VS Code title bar.
1. At the bottom of the chat view, in the chat input field, type: `Create a complete task manager web application with the ability to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Include modern CSS styling and make it responsive. Use semantic HTML and ensure it's accessible. Separate markup, styles, and scripts into their own files.`
1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Watch as the agent generates the necessary files and code to implement your request. You should see it update the `index.html` file, create a `styles.css` file for styling, and a `script.js` file for functionality.
1. Review the generated files and select Keep to accept all the changes.

## Get your first inline suggestion

The following example uses JavaScript, however other languages will work similarly. GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++. GitHub Copilot can also assist in query generation for databases, generating suggestions for APIs and frameworks, and can help with infrastructure as code development.


1. Open Visual Studio Code.
1. In Visual Studio Code, create a new JavaScript (_*.js_) file.

1. In the JavaScript file, type the following function header.

    ```javascript copy
    function calculateDaysBetweenDates(begin, end) {
    ```

   GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest an entire function body in grayed text. The exact suggestion may vary.
1. To accept the suggestion, press <kbd>Tab</kbd>.
