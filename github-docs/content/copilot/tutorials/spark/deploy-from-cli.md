# Deploy your Spark app from the command line

## Introduction

If you’re developing your spark further in a GitHub codespace, you can deploy it directly from the command line using the Spark CLI, an extension of the GitHub CLI.

### Prerequisites

* **Access to GitHub Copilot**. You need a Copilot Pro+, Copilot Max, or Copilot Enterprise license to use Spark. See [What Is GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/what-is-github-copilot#get-access).
* You must have **built a Spark app** (a "spark"). To start building, navigate to [Spark](https://github.com/spark).
* You have **created a repository** for your spark on GitHub. For instructions, see [Build Apps With Spark](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/tutorials/spark/build-apps-with-spark#step-8-invite-collaborators-with-a-repository).

## Open your spark in a codespace

The Spark CLI currently only works within a GitHub codespace.

1. Navigate to the main page of your spark's repository on GitHub.
1. Click the **{% octicon "code" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="code" %} Code** button, then click the **Codespaces** tab.
1. Click **{% octicon "plus" aria-label="Create a codespace on main" %}** to create a codespace. The codespace opens in a new browser tab.

## Install the Spark CLI

1. In the terminal in your codespace, run the following command to install the Spark CLI:

   ```bash copy
   gh extensions install github/gh-runtime-cli
   ```

1. Once the installation is complete, to verify that the Spark CLI is installed, run:

   ```bash copy
   gh runtime-cli version
   ```

## Build your spark

1. In the terminal in your codespace, run the following command to install the latest version of the Spark SDK:

   ```bash copy
   npm install @github/spark@latest
   ```

1. Next, run the following command to compile your Spark app.

   ```bash copy
   npm run build
   ```

## Deploy your spark

1. To deploy your Spark app, run:

   ```bash copy
   gh runtime-cli deploy --dir ./dist
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you're being asked to supply the `--app` parameter when deploying your spark, update to the latest version of the Spark SDK by following step 1 in [Build your spark](#build-your-spark).
