To enable streaming for Copilot agent session events and configure a streaming destination from your enterprise audit log settings, see [Streaming The Audit Log For Your Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/streaming-the-audit-log-for-your-enterprise#enabling-audit-log-streaming-of-copilot-agent-session-events).

In addition to streaming, you can also retrieve Copilot usage data through the REST API. See [Copilot Usage Metrics](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage-metrics#get-copilot-usage-records-for-an-enterprise).
