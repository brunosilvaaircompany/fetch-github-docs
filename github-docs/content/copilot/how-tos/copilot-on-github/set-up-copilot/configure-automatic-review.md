# Configuring automatic code review by GitHub Copilot

## Introduction

You can configure Copilot code review to review pull requests automatically. For an overview of automatic pull request reviews, see [Code Review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/code-review#about-automatic-pull-request-reviews).

## Configuring automatic code review for your own pull requests

> [!NOTE]
> This is only available if you are on the Copilot Pro, Copilot Pro+, or Copilot Max plans.

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile picture, then click **{% octicon "copilot" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="copilot" %} Copilot settings**.

1. Locate the **Automatic Copilot code review** option and click the dropdown button.

1. In the dropdown menu, select **Enabled**.

## Configuring automatic code review for a single repository

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

1. Under your repository name, click **{% octicon "gear" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="gear" %} Settings**. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the **{% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="More" %}** dropdown menu, then click **Settings**.

   ![Screenshot of a repository header showing the tabs. The "Settings" tab is highlighted by a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/repo-actions-settings.png)

1. In the left sidebar, under "Code and automation," click **Rules**, then click **Rulesets**.

   ![Screenshot of the sidebar of the "Settings" page for a repository. The "Rules" sub-menu is expanded, and the "Rulesets" option is outlined in orange.](/assets/images/help/repository/rulesets-settings.png)

1. Click **New ruleset**.
1. Click **New branch ruleset**.
1. Under "Ruleset name," type a name for the ruleset.
1. To activate the ruleset, under "Enforcement Status", select **Active**.

1. Under "Target branches," click **Add target** and choose one of the options—for example, **Include default branch** or **Include all branches**.
1. Under "Target branches," click **Add target** and choose one of the target options.
1. Under "Branch rules," select **Automatically request Copilot code review**.

   This expands a set of subsidiary options.

1. Optionally, if you want Copilot to review all new pushes to the pull request, select **Review new pushes**.

   If this option is not selected, Copilot will only review the pull request once.

1. Optionally, if you want Copilot to review pull requests while they are still drafts, select the **Review draft pull requests**.

   This can be a useful option for catching errors early, before requesting a human review.

1. At the bottom of the page, click **Create**.


## Configuring automatic code review for repositories in an organization

1. In the upper-right corner of GitHub, click your profile picture, then click **{% octicon "organization" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="organization" %} Organizations**.

1. Select an organization by clicking on it.
1. Under your organization name, click **{% octicon "gear" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="gear" %} Settings**. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the **{% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="More" %}** dropdown menu, then click **Settings**.

   ![Screenshot of the tabs in an organization's profile. The "Settings" tab is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/discussions/org-settings-global-nav-update.png)


1. In the sidebar, under "Code, planning, and automation",
 click **{% octicon "repo" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="repo" %} Repository**, then click **Rulesets**.

   ![Screenshot of an organization's settings page. In the sidebar, a link labeled "Rulesets" is outlined in orange.](/assets/images/help/organizations/sidebar-repository-rulesets.png)

1. Click **New ruleset**.
1. Click **New branch ruleset**.
1. Under "Ruleset name," type a name for the ruleset.
1. To activate the ruleset, under "Enforcement Status", select **Active**.

1. Under "Target repositories," click **Add target** and choose either **Include by pattern** or **Exclude by pattern**.
1. Type a pattern that matches the repository names you want to target—for example, `*feature` to match all repositories with names ending in `feature`.

   For pattern-matching syntax, see [Creating Rulesets For Repositories In Your Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/creating-rulesets-for-repositories-in-your-organization#using-fnmatch-syntax).

1. Click **Add inclusion pattern** or **Add exclusion pattern**.
1. Repeat for any additional patterns.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can add multiple targeting criteria to the same ruleset. Exclusion patterns are applied after inclusion patterns. For example, you could include any repositories matching the pattern `*cat*`, and specifically exclude a repository matching the pattern `not-a-cat`.

1. Under "Target branches," click **Add target** and choose one of the target options.
1. Under "Branch rules," select **Automatically request Copilot code review**.

   This expands a set of subsidiary options.

   ![Screenshot of the "Automatically request Copilot code review" branch ruleset option.](/assets/images/help/copilot/code-review/automatic-code-review.png)

1. Optionally, if you want Copilot to review all new pushes to the pull request, select **Review new pushes**.

   If this option is not selected, Copilot will only review the pull request once.

1. Optionally, if you want Copilot to review pull requests while they are still drafts, select the **Review draft pull requests**.

1. At the bottom of the page, click **Create**.


## Configuring review effort level for a repository

> [!NOTE]
> Medium review effort is in public preview and subject to change.

You can set the default review effort level that Copilot code review uses for automatic reviews in a repository. For an overview of review effort levels, see [Code Review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/code-review#review-effort-level).

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

1. Under your repository name, click **{% octicon "gear" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="gear" %} Settings**. If you cannot see the "Settings" tab, select the **{% octicon "kebab-horizontal" aria-label="More" %}** dropdown menu, then click **Settings**.

   ![Screenshot of a repository header showing the tabs. The "Settings" tab is highlighted by a dark orange outline.](/assets/images/help/repository/repo-actions-settings.png)

1. In the sidebar, under "Code, planning, and automation",
 click **{% octicon "copilot" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="copilot" %} Copilot**, then **Code review**.
1. Next to "Review effort level," select the effort level for automatic reviews in this repository.
   * **Low**: Standard review (default).
   * **Medium**: Deeper analysis of complex logic, security-sensitive code, and cross-service changes.

Medium reviews use more GitHub Actions minutes and AI credits. If you use Medium effort, consider configuring larger or self-hosted runners for better performance. See [Configure Runners](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/set-up-copilot/configure-runners).
