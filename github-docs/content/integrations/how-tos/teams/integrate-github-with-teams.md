# Integrating GitHub with Teams

## About the GitHub integration for Teams

The GitHub integration for Microsoft Teams gives you and your teams visibility into your GitHub projects directly in Teams channels. You can triage issues, collaborate on pull requests, and keep track of changes without leaving Teams.

With the GitHub integration for Teams, you can:

* Get **GitHub notifications** in Teams channels.
* Use **commands** to take actions on GitHub.
* See **previews** when sharing links to GitHub resources.

* Initiate a Copilot cloud agent session from Teams, using the context of a Teams thread.


When you grant the GitHub app access to your Teams workspace, you are granting it certain permissions. The permissions provided are necessary for the app to function correctly and provide the features you expect. See [Teams Permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/integrations/reference/teams-permissions).


## Prerequisites

To use the GitHub integration for Teams, you need:

* A GitHub account.
* A Teams workspace where you have permission to install apps.

## Installing the GitHub integration for Teams on GitHub Enterprise Server

1. Under "Select chat client", select **Microsoft Teams**, and follow the link to register an app in Microsoft Azure.
1. In Azure, configure the details for your app registration:
    * Enter your application registration **Name**.
    * Set the supported account types to **Multiple Entra ID tenants** and **Allow all tenants**.
1. Click **Register**.
1. Record the application (client) ID and tenant ID displayed.
1. Under **Certificates & secrets**, create a new client secret.

1. Enter the application (client) ID and tenant ID you recorded earlier, in the Teams bot configuration.
1. Depending on your network configuration for GitHub Enterprise Server:
    * If your instance _is reachable_ on the public internet, select the **Append '_msteams' to path** checkbox.
    * If your instance _is not reachable_ on the public internet and requires a proxy:
        * Ensure the **Append '_msteams' to path** checkbox isn't selected.
