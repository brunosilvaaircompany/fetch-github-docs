# Fixing code quality findings on a pull request

> [!TIP]
> If you're new to Code Quality, see [Catch Issues Before Merge?Utm_Campaign=Code Quality Ga July 2026&Utm_Medium=Docs&Utm_Source=Docs Fix Pr Findings Walkthrough Tip](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/tutorials/improve-code-quality/catch-issues-before-merge?utm_campaign=code-quality-ga-july-2026&utm_medium=docs&utm_source=docs-fix-pr-findings-walkthrough-tip) for a guided walkthrough of how Code Quality works on pull requests.

## How Code Quality works on pull requests

When you open a pull request, Code Quality runs **two types of analysis** and posts findings as comments on the pull request.

1. **`github-code-quality[bot]` findings**: Code Quality uses CodeQL to perform a rule-based scan of your changes. These findings are posted as comments by `github-code-quality[bot]` and include a suggested autofix. Findings are labeled by severity (**Error**, **Warning**, **Note**), and administrators can set quality gates to block merges based on the severity of these findings.

1. **Copilot findings**:  If your organization has Copilot licenses and AI features are enabled for your enterprise, Code Quality uses **Copilot code review** to identify quality issues that rules-based analysis may not detect. These findings are posted as comments by **Copilot**, and include a suggested autofix. See [Code Review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/code-review).

## Resolving a finding

1. On GitHub, navigate to your open pull request.
1. On the **Files Changed** tab, scroll to a comment left by **`github-code-quality[bot]`** or **Copilot**.
1. Carefully review the comment and the suggested autofix for logic, security, and style.

1. If you agree with the suggestion and you want to apply the fix, click **Commit suggestion**, or **Add suggestion to batch**.

1. Alternatively, if the finding isn't relevant or actionable, you can dismiss the finding. For example, you might dismiss a finding that is in legacy code no longer maintained, is a known exception to your team's coding standards, or is a false positive that doesn't pose a real quality risk.
   * For comments left by `github-code-quality[bot]`, click **Dismiss finding**.
   * For comments left by Copilot, click **Resolve**.

## Delegating remediation work to Copilot

If you have a Copilot license, you can delegate the remediation work to Copilot cloud agent. Comment on the pull request mentioning `@Copilot` and request that Copilot fix the detected issues.

Copilot responds with an eyes emoji (👀) to your comment, starts a new agent session, and opens a pull request with the necessary fixes.

You can track Copilot cloud agent's work:

* In the pull request, the summary is updated as work progresses.
* Using the [agents page](https://github.com/copilot/agents?ref_product=copilot&ref_type=engagement&ref_style=text) or session logs, see [Manage And Track Agents](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/use-copilot-agents/manage-and-track-agents).

You need a Copilot license to invoke Copilot cloud agent.
