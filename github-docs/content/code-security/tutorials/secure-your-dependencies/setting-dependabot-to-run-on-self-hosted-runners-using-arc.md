# Setting up Dependabot to run on self-hosted action runners using the Actions Runner Controller

## Working with the Actions Runner Controller (ARC)

This article provides step-by-step instructions for setting up ARC on a Kubernetes cluster and configuring Dependabot to run on self-hosted action runners. The article:

* Contains an overview of the ARC and Dependabot integration.
* Provides detailed installation and configuration steps using helm scripts.

## What is ARC?

The Actions Runner Controller is a Kubernetes controller that manages self-hosted GitHub Actions as Kubernetes pods. It allows you to dynamically scale and orchestrate runners based on your workflows, providing better resource utilization and integration with Kubernetes environments. See [Actions Runner Controller](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/runners/actions-runner-controller).

## Dependabot on ARC

You can run Dependabot on self-hosted GitHub Actions runners managed within a Kubernetes cluster via ARC. This enables auto-scaling, workload isolation, and better resource management for Dependabot jobs, ensuring that dependency updates can run efficiently within an organization's controlled infrastructure while integrating seamlessly with GitHub Actions.

## Setting up ARC for Dependabot on your Local environment

### Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster
  * For a managed cloud environment, you can use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
  * For a local setup, you can use minikube.
* Helm
  * A package manager for Kubernetes.

### Setting up ARC

1. Install ARC. For more information, see [Get Started](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/use-actions-runner-controller/get-started).
1. Create a work directory for the ARC setup and create a shell script file (for example, `helm_install_arc.sh`) to install the latest ARC version.

    ```bash copy
        mkdir ARC
        touch helm_install_arc.sh
        chmod 755 helm_install_arc.sh
    ```

1. Edit `helm_install_arc.sh` with this bash script for installing ARC.

   ```text copy
   NAMESPACE="arc-systems"
   helm install arc \
       --namespace "${NAMESPACE}" \
       --create-namespace \
       oci://ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner-controller-charts/gha-runner-scale-set-controller
   ```

1. Execute the `helm_install_arc.sh` script file.

   ```bash
   ./helm_install_arc.sh
   ```

1. Now, you need to configure the runner scale set. For this, let's start by creating and editing a file with the following bash script.

   ```bash copy
   touch arc-runner-set.sh
   chmod 755 arc-runner-set.sh
   ```

   ```text copy
   INSTALLATION_NAME="dependabot"
   NAMESPACE="arc-runners"
   GITHUB_CONFIG_URL=REPO_URL
   GITHUB_PAT=PAT
   helm install "${INSTALLATION_NAME}" \
       --namespace "${NAMESPACE}" \
       --create-namespace \
       --set githubConfigUrl="${GITHUB_CONFIG_URL}" \
       --set githubConfigSecret.github_token="${GITHUB_PAT}" \
       --set containerMode.type="dind" \
       oci://ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner-controller-charts/gha-runner-scale-set
   ```

1. Execute the `arc-runner-set.sh` script file.

   ```bash copy
   ./arc-runner-set.sh
   ```

> [!NOTE]
>
> * The installation name of the runner scale set has to be `dependabot` in order to target the dependabot job to the runner.
> * The `containerMode.type="dind"` configuration is required to allow the runner to connect to the Docker daemon.
> * If an organization-level or enterprise-level runner is created, then the appropriate scopes should be provided to the Personal Access Token (PAT).
> * A personal access token (classic) (PAT) can be created. The token should have the following scopes based on whether you are creating a repository, organization or enterprise level runner scale set.
>   * Repository level: **repo**
>   * Organization level: **admin:org**
>   * Enterprise level: **admin:enterprise**\
>   For information about creating a personal access token (classic), see [Managing Your Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).

### Adding runner groups

Runner groups are used to control which organizations or repositories have access to runner scale sets. To add a runner scale set to a runner group, you must already have a runner group created.

For information about creating runner groups, see [Manage Access](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-runners/self-hosted-runners/manage-access#creating-a-self-hosted-runner-group-for-an-organization).

Don't forget to add the following setting to the runner scale set configuration in the helm chart.

   ```text copy
   --set runnerGroup="<Runner group name>" \
   ```

### Checking your installation

1. Check your installation.

    ```bash copy
    helm list -A
    ```

    Output:

    ```text
    ➜  ARC git:(master) ✗ helm list -A
        NAME           NAMESPACE   REVISION UPDATED                              STATUS   CHART                                  APP VERSION

    ```

1. Check the manager pod using this command.

    ```bash copy
    kubectl get pods -n arc-systems
    ```

    Output:

    ```text
    ➜  ARC git:(master) ✗ kubectl get pods -n arc-systems
