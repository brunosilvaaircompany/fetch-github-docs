# Using cost centers to allocate costs to business units

>[!NOTE] Before you create or update a cost center, if you're unsure of how spending will be allocated to the cost center, see [Cost Center Allocation](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/reference/cost-center-allocation).

## Creating a cost center

> [!NOTE]
> An enterprise can create up to 500 cost centers.

Create cost centers to monitor and manage expenses for specific organizations or repositories. A single cost center can include multiple resources of any type, such as organizations, repositories, users, and enterprise teams.

When you create a cost center, you can add **organizations**, **repositories**, **users**, or **enterprise teams**. The cost center will then track spending for the selected entities.

You can assign an enterprise team to a cost center. Every member of the team is added to the cost center, and membership stays current automatically as people join or leave the team—so you don't have to add or remove users one by one. For more information about enterprise teams, see [Create Enterprise Teams](https://docs.github.com/en/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/create-enterprise-teams).

   > [!NOTE]
   > A resource (organization, repository, user, or enterprise team) can belong to only one cost center at a time. A cost center can hold many resources, but each resource lives in a single cost center. If you add a resource that belongs to a different cost center, it will be moved to the new cost center and you will be notified.

1. Click **Create cost center**.


## Adding a budget to a cost center

After you create a cost center, you can add a monthly budget and receive alerts from the cost center to monitor your spending and usage. See [Set Up Budgets](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/how-tos/set-up-budgets).
