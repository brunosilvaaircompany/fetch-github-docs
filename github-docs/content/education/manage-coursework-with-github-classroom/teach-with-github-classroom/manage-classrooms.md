# Manage classrooms

## About classrooms

A classroom in GitHub Classroom is where teachers and students interact during a course. Teachers can create a student roster for the classroom, then create, assign, review, and grade assignments within the classroom.


## About management of classrooms

GitHub Classroom uses organization accounts on GitHub to manage permissions, administration, and security for each classroom that you create. Each organization can have multiple classrooms.

After you create a classroom, GitHub Classroom will prompt you to invite teaching assistants (TAs) and admins to the classroom. Each classroom can have one or more admins. Admins can be teachers, TAs, or any other course administrator who you'd like to have control over your classrooms on GitHub Classroom.

Invite TAs and admins to your classroom by inviting the personal accounts on GitHub to your organization as organization owners and sharing the URL for your classroom. Organization owners can administer any classroom for the organization. For more information, see [Roles In An Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization) and [Inviting Users To Join Your Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization).

When you're done using a classroom, you can archive the classroom and refer to the classroom, roster, and assignments later, or you can delete the classroom if you no longer need the classroom.

You can reuse existing assignments in any other classroom you have admin access to, including classrooms in a different organization. For more information, see [Reuse An Assignment](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/reuse-an-assignment).


You can also view your classrooms and assignments directly from the GitHub command line interface with the GitHub Classroom extension. For more information, see [Using GitHub Classroom With GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/using-github-classroom-with-github-cli).

## About classroom rosters

Each classroom has a roster. A roster is a list of identifiers for the students who participate in your course.

When you first share the URL for an assignment with a student, the student must sign into GitHub with a personal account to link the personal account to an identifier for the classroom. After the student links a personal account, you can see the associated personal account in the roster. You can also see when the student accepts or submits an assignment.

## Prerequisites

You must have an organization account on GitHub to manage classrooms on GitHub Classroom. For more information, see [Types Of GitHub Accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts#organization-accounts) and [Creating A New Organization From Scratch](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch).

You must authorize the OAuth app for GitHub Classroom for your organization to manage classrooms for your organization account. For more information, see [Authorizing OAUTH Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps).
