# Creating a custom 404 page for your GitHub Pages site

1. On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository.

1. Navigate to the publishing source for your site. For more information, see [Configuring A Publishing Source For Your GitHub Pages Site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).

1. Above the list of files, select the **Add file** {% octicon "triangle-down" aria-label="The downwards-facing triangle icon" %} dropdown menu, then click **{% octicon "plus" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="plus" %} Create new file**.

   Alternatively, you can click {% octicon "plus" aria-label="The plus sign icon" %} in the file tree view on the left.

1. In the file name field, type `404.html` or `404.md`.
1. If you named your file `404.md`, add the following YAML front matter to the beginning of the file:

   ```yaml
   ---
   permalink: /404.html
   ---
   ```

1. Below the YAML front matter, if present, add the content you want to display on your 404 page.
1. Click **Commit changes...**

1. In the "Commit message" field, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see [Creating A Commit With Multiple Authors](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors).


1. If you have more than one email address associated with your account on GitHub, click the email address drop-down menu and select the email address to use as the Git author email address. Only verified email addresses appear in this drop-down menu. If you enabled email address privacy, then a no-reply will be the default commit author email address. For more information about the exact form the no-reply email address can take, see [Setting Your Commit Email Address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address).

1. Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see [Creating A Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

1. Click **Commit changes** or **Propose changes**.
