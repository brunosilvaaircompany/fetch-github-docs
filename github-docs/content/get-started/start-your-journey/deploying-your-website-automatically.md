# Deploying your website automatically

Your feature is merged, so now you can share it. In this tutorial, you'll set up automatic deployment so every push to `main` publishes your software project to a live website.

> [!NOTE]
> The URL of your GitHub Pages site depends on which version of GitHub you use.
> * On GitHub.com, your site is published at `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY`.
> * If you use GitHub with data residency on GHE.com, your site is published at `pages.SUBDOMAIN.ghe.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY`, where `SUBDOMAIN` is your enterprise's subdomain.
> * On GitHub Enterprise Server, your site is published at `pages.HOSTNAME/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY`, where `HOSTNAME` is the hostname of your GitHub Enterprise Server instance.

## Prerequisites

* A `stargazers-log` repository with your merged feature. If you haven't merged it yet, see [Reviewing Your Proposed Changes](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/reviewing-your-proposed-changes).

## Enabling GitHub Pages

Set up GitHub Pages to host your site, and use GitHub Actions to build and publish it.

1. On GitHub, navigate to your `stargazers-log` repository.
1. Under your repository name, click **Settings**.
1. In the sidebar, in the "Code and automation" section, click **Pages**.
1. Under "Build and deployment", from the **Source** dropdown, select **GitHub Actions**.

Leave the other settings at their defaults. Next, you'll create **your own workflow** to build and deploy your site automatically.

## Creating a deployment workflow

A workflow is a set of automated steps that GitHub Actions runs for you. Add one that builds and deploys your site whenever you push to `main`.

1. In your repository, create a file named `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
    1. On the main page of your `stargazers-log` repository above the list of files, click **{% octicon "plus" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="plus" %}**, then click **{% octicon "plus" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="plus" %} Create new file**.
    1. In the file name field, type `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
1. Add the following workflow content.

   ```yaml copy
   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   permissions:
     contents: read
     pages: write
     id-token: write

   jobs:
     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       environment:
         name: github-pages
         url: {% raw %}${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}{% endraw %}
       steps:
         - name: Checkout
           uses: {% data reusables.actions.action-checkout %}
         - name: Setup Pages
           uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
         - name: Upload artifact
   {%- ifversion fpt or ghec %}
           uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4
   {%- elsif ghes %}
           uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
   {%- endif %}
           with:
             path: '.'
         - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
   {%- ifversion fpt or ghec %}
           id: deployment
           uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
   {%- elsif ghes %}
           id: deployment
           uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
   {%- endif %}
   ```

1. Commit the file directly to the `main` branch.

## Understanding the workflow

Each part of the workflow has a job to do:

* **`on`** tells GitHub Actions to run the workflow on every push to `main`.
* **`permissions`** grant the workflow the access it needs to publish to GitHub Pages.
* **`environment`** connects the job to your GitHub Pages site and exposes the published URL as {% raw %}`${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}`{% endraw %}.
* **`steps`** check out your code, prepare GitHub Pages, upload your files as an artifact, and deploy them to your live site.

## Viewing your live site

After you commit the workflow, GitHub Actions runs it automatically.

1. In your repository, click the **Actions** tab to watch the workflow run.
1. Click the latest workflow run to see a summary of the job details.
1. When the run completes, open your published site at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/stargazers-log/`. Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your username, and replace `HOSTNAME` with your GitHub Enterprise Server hostname.
    * For example, if your GitHub account username is `octocat`, your site is at `https://octocat.github.io/stargazers-log/`.

From now on, every push to `main` redeploys your site with your latest changes.

| ----- | ---------------- |
| Creating your software project | Repositories, README files |
| Planning your work | Issues, Projects (project boards) |
| Connecting locally | GitHub Desktop, cloning |
| Writing and storing code | Branches, commits, pull requests, Copilot |
| Reviewing changes | Pull request reviews, Copilot |
| Deploying automatically | GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages |
