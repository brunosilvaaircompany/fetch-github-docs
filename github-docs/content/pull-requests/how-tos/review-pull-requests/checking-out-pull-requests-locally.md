# Checking out pull requests locally

> [!NOTE]
> Pull request authors can give upstream repository maintainers, or people with push access to the upstream repository, permission to make commits to their pull request's compare branch in a user-owned fork. See [Allowing Changes To A Pull Request Branch Created From A Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/how-tos/work-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).

## Modifying an active pull request locally

{% webui %}

1. Under your repository name, click **{% octicon "git-pull-request" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="git-pull-request" %} Pull requests**.

1. In the list of pull requests, click the pull request you want to modify.
1. To choose where you want to open the pull request, select the **{% octicon "code" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="code" %} Code** dropdown and click one of the tabs.

{% endwebui %}

{% cli %}

To check out a pull request locally, use the `gh pr checkout` subcommand. Replace `PULL-REQUEST` with the number, URL, or head branch of the pull request.

```shell
gh pr checkout PULL-REQUEST
```

{% endcli %}

## Modifying an inactive pull request locally

If a pull request’s author is unresponsive to requests or has deleted their fork, the changes proposed in that pull request can still be merged through a new pull request. However, if you want to make changes, you need to take additional steps to update the pull request.

After a pull request is opened, GitHub stores all of the changes remotely. Commits in a pull request are available in a repository even before the pull request is merged. You can fetch an open pull request and recreate it as your own.

Anyone can work with a previously opened pull request to continue working on it, test it, or open a new pull request with additional changes.

1. Under your repository name, click **{% octicon "git-pull-request" aria-hidden="true" aria-label="git-pull-request" %} Pull requests**.

1. In the **Pull Requests** list, click the pull request you want to merge.
1. Find the ID number of the inactive pull request. This is the sequence of digits right after the pull request's title.

   ![Screenshot of the title of a pull request. The pull request's ID number is outlined in dark orange.](/assets/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-id-number.png)

1. Open your terminal or Git Bash.
1. Fetch the reference to the pull request based on its ID number. This creates a new branch. Use the pull request ID and the name of the local branch you want to create in the command.

   ```shell
   git fetch origin pull/ID/head:BRANCH_NAME
   ```

1. Switch to the new branch that's based on this pull request:

   ```shell
   [main] $ git switch BRANCH_NAME
   > Switched to a new branch 'BRANCH_NAME'
   ```

1. Make any needed changes to this branch. You can run local tests or merge other branches into the branch.
1. When you're ready, push the new branch:

   ```shell
   [pull-inactive-pull-request] $ git push origin BRANCH_NAME
   > Counting objects: 32, done.
   > Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
   > Compressing objects: 100% (26/26), done.
   > Writing objects: 100% (29/29), 74.94 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
   > Total 29 (delta 8), reused 0 (delta 0)
   > To https://{% data variables.product.product_url %}/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
   >  * [new branch]      BRANCH_NAME -> BRANCH_NAME
   ```

1. Create a new pull request with your new branch.

## Error: Failed to push some refs

The remote `refs/pull/` namespace is _read-only_. If you try to push commits there, you'll see this error:

```shell
! [remote rejected] HEAD -> refs/pull/1/head (deny updating a hidden ref)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.local:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git'
```

> [!TIP]
> When you remove or rename a remote reference, calls to `git-remote` do not affect your local `refs/pull/origin/` namespace.
