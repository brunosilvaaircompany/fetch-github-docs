# REST API endpoints for repository pre-receive hooks

## About repository pre-receive hooks

> [!NOTE]
> These endpoints only support authentication using a personal access token (classic). For more information, see [Managing Your Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).


| Name                | Type     | Description                                               |
|---------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`              | `string` | The name of the hook.                                     |
| `enforcement`       | `string` | The state of enforcement for the hook on this repository. |
| `configuration_url` | `string` | URL for the endpoint where enforcement is set.            |

Possible values for _enforcement_ are `enabled`, `disabled` and`testing`. `disabled` indicates the pre-receive hook will not run. `enabled` indicates it will run and reject any pushes that result in a non-zero status. `testing` means the script will run but will not cause any pushes to be rejected.

`configuration_url` may be a link to this repository, its organization owner or global configuration. Authorization to access the endpoint at `configuration_url` is determined at the owner or site admin level.
